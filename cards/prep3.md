USING THE CARD SERIES
---------------------

Although each training is intended to be  brief, it’s the repetition of the message and consistency of the lessons that will yield the greatest impact. Follow the guidelines below – evidence has shown this results in the greatest success for your athletes.

- Throughout the season, go through the twelve Training Cards, in order, with your team; take at least 15 – 20 minutes, once a  week, per card. To ensure your athletes will be receptive, set aside a consistent weekly time that fits your team’s schedule.
- Review the **Objectives** for each lesson to get prepared for the focus of that day’s training. 
- Gather your athletes and start the training with the **Warm Up**. You can read the sample language as a speech directly from the card or tailor it as you like. The **Warm Up** helps get your athletes focused on the training topic.
- Next, **Ask the Players** the suggested questions keeping in mind the **Discussion Points & Wrap Up** included to facilitate the conversation. Create a respectful, safe environment where your  athletes can share their ideas freely and ask honest questions. Give them time to answer and, most importantly, make sure they know you’re listening and care about what they have to say.
- Close each training with the **Discussion Points & Wrap Up**. This closure will help reinforce the session’s objectives and key points.

ADAPTING CBIM TO YOU AND YOUR TEAM
----------------------------------

The guidelines listed above provide the framework for delivering the program, but the specific method is up to you. You know your athletes best. 

Here are a few suggestions:

- Use your voice and your style; your athletes are used to hearing that and responding. Choose examples that are relevant to your team – from their sport, the community, or current events.
- Be creative. If field or court time is unavailable, hold your CBIM trainings in a classroom or use the time spent traveling together on the road.
- Enlist your assistant coaches and ask them to deliver a lesson or two. Your athletes may benefit from hearing these important messages from multiple adults whom they look up to and admire. 
- Encourage your team captains or the upperclassmen on your team to reinforce the importance of the CBIM trainings by modeling respectful behavior to their teammates. 
- Refer to the Halftime and Overtime cards throughout the season to bring your team’s CBIM commitment to the community at large.
