**This training will help athletes:**
1. **Recognize the importance of talking with their partner about what’s okay, or not okay, in their relationships.**
2. **Initiate conversations about setting boundaries in relationships.**

Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
We’ve talked a lot about 
respect and relationships this season. 
I’m proud of the conversations we’ve 
had, and today I want to talk about 
what characterizes a good and 
successful relationship. Whether 
you’re just friends, hooking up, or in 
a relationship with someone, there 
are certain things that everyone 
deserves. Respect, trust, and support 
are just three things central to a 
healthy and positive relationship. 
I want you guys to show these and 
to expect them in return. 
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. In a good relationship, what are things you 
think both people deserve?
2. Do you think it’s important for people in 
relationships to talk about what each other 
deserves? Why or why not?
3. Have you ever been in a relationship 
where you and your partner disagreed about 
something (like how much or how little time 
you spend together)? How did you handle it?
4. What are respectful ways to approach 
disagreements?


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Good relationships are built on many things – like mutual respect. Respecting someone 
means asking what they are comfortable with 
and listening to what they say.
- It’s important that both people trust and 
support each other. Everyone deserves to have 
their own interests outside of their relationship.
- I know that conversations about your 
relationship can be awkward and sometimes 
upsetting. But having these conversations 
early may avoid even more awkwardness and 
discomfort later.
- All relationships have issues and 
disagreements, and that’s okay. Talking 
to the other person directly and respectfully 
about what’s bothering you can help you 
come to a mutual understanding. 
- Talking to friends about your relationship 
can be helpful. It’s important to ask them to 
keep it private unless someone is being abused.
- Approach disagreements respectfully. Talk 
to a trusted adult if you ever need help.
