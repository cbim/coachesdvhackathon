Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
Today I want to 
talk with you about the 
impact of demeaning 
language. Sometimes we 
don’t realize how 
harmful the words we use 
can be. Or sometimes we 
purposely use words that 
are disrespectful 
without understanding 
their true impact.
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What are respectful ways we can use 
language to help a fellow teammate who 
may not be playing so well?
2. What do you think about saying to 
a guy “You’re playing like a girl”? Why 
might this also be insulting to girls?
3. How do you feel when someone uses 
demeaning language when talking about 
people you care about?
4. How would you feel if someone talked 
negatively about something you have no 
control over, like how you look?

Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Instead of taunting or mocking, help 
your teammates out by providing positive 
suggestions for how they can improve.
- Insults like “you play like a girl” may 
seem harmless, but they’re not. Using 
gender to insult someone reinforces 
negative stereotypes about women. 
I think that is unacceptable.
- It’s also demeaning to make negative 
comments about someone’s race, 
appearance, disability, or sexual orientation.
- If it’s something you wouldn’t like said 
about you, don’t say it about someone else
