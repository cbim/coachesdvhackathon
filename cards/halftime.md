- Tell your school newspaper or local sports reporter about the CBIM 
program and your teamâ€™s focus on 
strengthening respect for each other, 
and particularly for women and girls.
- The community should know that your 
athletes not only perform well on the 
field, but are upstanding young men off the field, too.
- Your athletes will be proud to see that 
the community is recognizing their 
commitment.
- This is a great way to involve the 
broader community and provide other 
opportunities for your athletes to model respectful behavior.
