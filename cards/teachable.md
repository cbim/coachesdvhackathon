Step 1: STOP
------------
You just noticed disrespectful or 
damaging behavior. What happened? 
What did you hear? What did you see?

Step 2: CALL A TIME OUT
-----------------------
If it’s appropriate at that time to share 
with the team as a whole, then take a 
few minutes to bring everyone together. 
Recap what you witnessed and tell the 
athletes that this was wrong. Sometimes, 
situations occur that require you to 
address the individual in a one-on-one 
conversation or in a more private manner. 

Step 3: DEFENSE
---------------
Correct the language and behavior by 
explaining WHY it was wrong, referencing 
some of the trainings throughout the 
season. Whenever possible, make the 
moment a lesson for the entire team.

Step 4: GO ON THE OFFENSE
-------------------------
Make sure your athletes understand how 
the incident relates to the principles of 
respect. Ask them to suggest ways the 
incident could have been prevented. 
What positive alternatives were available?

<strong>
*It’s also important to take a time out to 
commend positive, respectful behavior!
