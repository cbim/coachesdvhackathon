- Make your team’s next home game a 
Fan Pledge Day!
- During pre-game or halftime, use the 
loud speaker to announce your team’s 
commitment to respecting others, 
particularly women and girls. Encourage fans to sign Pledge Cards that your 
team can distribute before the game.
- Have your players collect Pledges from 
the fans. It will be a good way to help 
them engage with others about their 
commitment.
- Create a CBIM board where you display all collected pledges. Be sure to 
feature the board in a public place (e.g. 
gym, hallway).
- Your players will be the stars of the 
game and of the community for their 
public promise to respect others.
- Make an even greater impact! Ask 
your fans to donate to a local domestic 
violence shelter or violence prevention 
organization 
in your community
