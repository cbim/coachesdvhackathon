Host a Fan Pledge Day
---------------------
- Make your team’s next home game a 
Fan Pledge Day!
- During pre-game or halftime, use the 
loud speaker to announce your team’s 
commitment to respecting others, 
particularly women and girls. Encourage fans to sign Pledge Cards that your 
team can distribute before the game.
- Have your players collect Pledges from 
the fans. It will be a good way to help 
them engage with others about their 
commitment.
- Create a CBIM board where you display all collected pledges. Be sure to 
feature the board in a public place (e.g. 
gym, hallway).
- Your players will be the stars of the 
game and of the community for their 
public promise to respect others.
- Make an even greater impact! Ask 
your fans to donate to a local domestic 
violence shelter or violence prevention 
organization 
in your community

Create a Team Campaign
----------------------
- Have your athletes create their own 
messages, posters, video, or web page 
that describe the principles of the 
program and their role in showing and 
encouraging respect on and off the 
field.
- Post these messages in a public 
place like in the auditorium, the gym, 
the cafeteria, or the hallways of the 
school.
- Involve your campus radio station or 
daily public announcements to broadcast 
your team’s CBIM message of respect for 
women and girls to the entire 
school community.
