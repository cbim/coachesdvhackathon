<strong>
This training will help athletes:
1. Recognize that the actions they take online 
and on their cell phone have real consequences.
2. Refuse to participate in abusive or 
controlling digital behavior including sending 
repeated and unwanted text messages, violating 
someone’s privacy, or pressuring someone for a 
naked, private, or embarrassing picture.
3. Create safe and respectful digital spaces for 
themselves and others.

Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
We’ve talked about how the 
words you use and the actions you 
take can be disrespectful or harmful to 
others. This goes for what you do online 
and on your cell phones, too. Sometimes 
we minimize the seriousness of things 
when we’re not face to face with 
someone. Sometimes we don’t realize 
that our text messages can be controlling, 
overwhelming, or mean. What happens 
online is real and sometimes very 
public for all the world to see. Friendships 
and dating relationships are shaped by 
what we do and what we say – no 
matter where it takes place. It’s important 
that we use technology safely 
and respectfully

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What are some benefits of things like 
social networking, chatting, and texting? 
What are some not so great things?
2. How would you feel if someone posted private 
or embarrassing comments about you online?
3. How might someone you’re seeing feel 
if you constantly sent him/her texts asking 
where he/she is, who he/she’s with, what he/
she’s wearing, and what he/she’s doing? 
4. How would you feel if someone repeatedly 
pressured you to do something you didn’t want 
to do, like sending a nude or private picture? 


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Digital communication helps us keep in 
touch with others, but it can also make boundaries unclear. Talk with your partner about 
what you think is okay and not okay behavior. 
- Everyone needs space sometimes. Be 
respectful of what other people are okay with 
over text message, and be clear about what’s 
okay with you. Sometimes it’s not just the 
number of texts being sent or received but 
the content of the messages that really matter.
- It is NEVER okay to pressure someone for 
a nude or private picture. It’s also wrong to 
share these pictures with other people. Sending nude pictures has serious consequences 
and some teens have even faced criminal 
charges. If you receive a nude picture, delete 
it immediately and tell an adult you trust. 
- Pressure, control, or threats are NEVER 
okay whether online or not. 
- What you say and do online is a reflection of you, and of this team.
