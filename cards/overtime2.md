- Have your athletes create their own 
messages, posters, video, or web page 
that describe the principles of the 
program and their role in showing and 
encouraging respect on and off the 
field.
- Post these messages in a public 
place like in the auditorium, the gym, 
the cafeteria, or the hallways of the 
school.
- Involve your campus radio station or 
daily public announcements to broadcast 
your teamâ€™s CBIM message of respect for 
women and girls to the entire 
school community.
