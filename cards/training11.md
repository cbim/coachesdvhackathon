Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
I’m proud of this team. 
You’ve done a great job 
representing us on and off the 
field. You’ve been willing to consider 
hard questions about what’s okay, or 
not okay, in your relationships. You 
may not realize it, but you’re all role 
models at this school. You’ve really 
stepped up and I want you guys to 
support each other and remind each 
other to be respectful towards 
others. As we’ve discussed, this 
includes treating women and girls as 
equals. You are growing up to 
be men I admire.
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What are ways you can show respect in 
your relationships and friendships?
2. How can you and your teammates support 
each other in being responsible on and off 
the field?
3. What can you do if you hear your friend 
being disrespectful towards a girl?
4. As someone other players and students look 
up to in this school, what are ways you can 
share these principles of respect with others?


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- You can show respect to others in many 
ways, like valuing and supporting their personal 
boundaries, decisions, and individuality.
- By showing respect towards women and 
girls in your language and actions, you’re not 
only doing the right thing, you’re setting an 
example for others. 
- If you witness one of your teammates using 
inappropriate language or behavior or being 
disrespectful to a girl, don’t join in on it. CALL 
HIM ON IT.
- If you witness a situation and it makes you 
feel unsafe, don’t get involved directly. Ask a 
trusted adult for help.
- Think of ways you can share the principles 
of respect – teamwork, responsibility, integrity, 
non-violence – with your community. 
- You are all part of something positive at this 
school. Your commitment to respect is also a 
responsibility – defend it and share it.
