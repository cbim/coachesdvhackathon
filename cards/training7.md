This training will help athletes:
1. Recognize that bragging or lying about 
their sexual reputation is disrespectful and 
wrong.
2. Recognize that spreading stories about 
someone else’s sexual activity can be 
disrespectful and harmful.
3. Refuse to spread private information 
or to speak disrespectfully about another 
person’s sexual reputation.
</strong>

Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
I know that there’s a lot 
of pressure to be popular and 
hook up. Some people think this 
means bragging about what you 
and your friends may do sexually. 
The men I respect treat women 
and girls as their equals. They 
don’t joke, lie, or brag about 
what they do intimately 
with anybody. 
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What do you think about when someone 
is bragging about their hook up?
2. Why might someone involved in your
stories not appreciate your storytelling?
3. Why is it disrespectful to listen to or laugh 
when a friend is talking about what he does 
sexually?


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- You guys might be feeling pressure to be 
popular and hook up, but bragging or lying 
about sex or intimate experiences isn’t the 
way to do it. It’s not only disrespectful to the 
other person; broadcasting your personal life 
like that disrespects yourself, too.
- Whether it’s true or not, it can be harmful to 
talk or spread rumors about someone’s sexual 
reputation. They may become depressed, 
isolated, or even put in danger by those 
comments. My opinion is that such information 
shouldn’t be shared. When you hear stories 
about someone’s sexual experiences, don’t 
laugh or encourage it. It’s best to ask the 
person to stop or leave the situation.
- The men I look up to treat the women in 
their lives with respect.
- It’s important not to brag about the 
intimate details of your relationships and 
friendships. If you have questions about 
sex and sexuality, discuss them with me or 
someone you trust and let them know you 
want them to keep it private.
