Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
Last week we went over 
some of the things I expect you 
guys to be responsible for, such 
as getting to practice on time, 
working hard, and respecting each 
other. I also want you guys to be 
accountable for your actions.
You are the person responsible 
and accountable for everything 
you say and do – in sports and 
in your everyday life.
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What does it mean to be responsible 
for your actions on the field?
2. How do your actions off the field 
represent the team, your school, and your 
community?
3. How do you hold yourself accountable 
off the field?

Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Be a team player. This means respecting 
your teammates, displaying good 
sportsmanship, and being in control of 
your own actions.
- You reflect our team, our school, the 
community, and your family and friends. 
- Accountability means holding yourself 
responsible – and that is something that 
you, and only you, can do.
- One thing we’re going to focus on this 
season is that there are real consequences 
for yourself and others when you don’t 
treat people with respect.
