This season you’ve

team players. I’ve also been 
impressed with your leadership in 
showing respect for others. 
You guys are becoming great 
players in the game and are 
turning out to be great men in life. 
I respect each of you for treating 
women and girls with respect. 
In recognition of the 
commitment you’ve all made, 
I want us to read and sign 
this Pledge together
</blockquote>

Coach and Player Pledge
-----------------------
I commit to take a stand against 
relationship abuse and I believe that 
violence is neither a solution nor a sign 
of strength. I understand that by treating 
everyone with respect, I am a role model 
to others. By taking this pledge, I publicly 
denounce violence against women and 
girls. A world of respect starts today and 
starts with me.


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- We will sign and post this pledge 
in the gym or school hallway so your 
commitment will be known and 
recognized.
- This is the beginning, not the end. 
You know that I share this commitment 
with you and I want you to come to me 
anytime for advice, to ask questions, or to 
discuss any situation that might come up.
