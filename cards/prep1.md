Winning games is important to every coach. However, it shouldn't be the only goal. A big part of the job is helping to develop solid, responsible athletes who are able to become upstanding citizens. Coaching Boys into Men (CBIM) equips coaches with tools to help their young athletes build respectful, non-violent relationships.


Familiarize yourself with the CBIM Playbook. It's the foundation of the program and an essential tool that includes:

* Facts and information about relationship violence and abuse
* Teachable moment scenarios;
* Tips and tactics on how to talk to your athletes.
