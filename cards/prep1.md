Winning games is important to every coach. However, it shouldn’t be the only goal. A big part of the job is helping to develop solid, responsible athletes who become upstanding citizens. Coaching Boys into Men (CBIM) equips coaches with tools to help their young athletes build respectful, non-violent relationships.
</strong>

CBIM PLAYBOOK
-------------
Familiarize yourself with the CBIM Playbook. It’s the foundation of the program and an essential tool that includes:

- Facts and information about building healthy relationships and a stronger team;
- Teachable moment scenarios;
- Tips and tactics on how to talk to
your athletes.

CBIM CARD SERIES
----------------
Use the Card Series to lead weekly discussions with your athletes throughout the season. The set includes:

- **Prep Cards** to help you get ready for the season.
- **Trainign Cards** each with a key topic for you to discuss with your athletes each week (at least 15 – 20 minutes per week).
- **Halftime and Overtime Cards** to use throughout the season to highlight your team’s commitment.
- **Teachable Moment Card** to help you respond to harmful behavior or language.

PREPARE FOR TEACHABLE MOMENTS
-----------------------------
As a coach you have both an offensive game plan and a defensive one. It's important to be proactive by going on the offensive and conducting weekly trainings with your athletes. It's equally important to build an effective defensive plan to respond to disrespectful or abusive situations that may arise among your players or in the news. When you see or hear a serious problem, use the **Teachable Moment Card** to address it immediately and take the opportunity to reinforce and model positive language and behavior.
