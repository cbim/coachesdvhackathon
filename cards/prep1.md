Welcome to Coaching Boys into Men
---------------------------------
Whether you're a coach, a school administrator, a parent, a violence prevention activist, or a community leader, YOU have a role in Coaching Boys into Men (CBIM). By coaching boys into men, you are helping the next generation build respectful and non-violent relationships.

**Coaching Boys into Men® is a Coaches Leadership Program that partners with athletic coaches to help young male athletes practice respect towards themselves and others.** Athletic coaches play an extremely influential and unique role in the lives of young men, often serving as a parent or mentor to the boys they coach. Because of these special relationships, coaches are poised to positively influence how young men think and behave both on, and off, the field. From speeches to the team, practice sessions, or simply casual conversation, coaches have many opportunities to impart their philosophies upon their athletes. Through a series of twelve weekly trainings, the program equips coaches to talk with their athletes about respect for women and girls and that violence doesn't equal strength. CBIM teaches athletes the skills to avoid violence and abuse in their relationships.

How to use this application
---------------------------
- This application is a digital complement to the **CBIM Card Series**. The Card Series helps coaches integrate the lessons of respect in relationships into twelve weekly trainings throughout their athletic season.
- The **Prep Cards** found in this application will help prepare you for the season. 
- Use the **Trainings** to lead CBIM with your team. All twelve trainings can be found within this application. Each training includes the lesson’s **Objectives**, a **Warm Up** speech to help introduce the topic, **Ask the Players** suggested questions, and **Discussion Points & Wrap Up** to help facilitate the discussion. 
- When you see or hear a serious problem, use the **Teachable Moment** card to address it immediately and take the opportunity to reinforce and model positive language and behavior.
- When you feel something is more serious than you can handle, there are experts and resources available to you and your athletes. Refer to the **Need Help** list for more resources.

Getting Started
---------------
- The beginning of the sports season is a convenient time to start Coaching Boys into Men (CBIM).
- **Set aside at least 15-20 minutes per week** to lead your athletes through each Training in the Card Series. Each training will encourage your athletes to discuss and practice respect and non-violence for themselves, others, and the women and girls in their lives. 
- Although each of the trainings is intended to be brief, it’s the consistency of the message and repeated weekly lessons that will make the greatest impact. We recommend leading the trainingson a weekly basis, in sequential order, and completing the series over the course of the season.
