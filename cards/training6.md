Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
Communication can be 
challenging in any relationship, but 
never is it more critical than in a 
physically intimate or sexual situation. 
Whether with someone you like and 
know or with someone you just met, 
it’s extremely important that you openly 
discuss and respect personal boundaries. 
Create space for you and that person to 
talk about what you’re comfortable with. 
If either of you feels unsure, uncomfortable, or is unable to really make the 
decision to get involved, that must be 
respected. Intimate and sexual situations 
should always be safe, sober, 
and non-violent.
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What does consent mean?
2. How do you determine consent? What 
if you’re not sure what your date or partner 
feels comfortable with? 
3. What are ways pressure and threats can 
be used to make someone do something they 
don’t want to do?
4. What can you do if you notice someone in 
a dangerous or non-consensual situation? 


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Consent means that after thoughtful 
consideration, both you and your partner agree 
to and feel comfortable and safe with a specific 
situation. Consent for one thing, like a hug, 
doesn’t mean consent for another, like a kiss. 
 Ask and listen to what the other person 
wants. If anyone feels unsure or uncomfortable, show respect and STOP the situation.
- It is NEVER okay to use pressure or threats 
to coerce someone into a sexual situation.
- Drugs and alcohol can impair judgment 
and create dangerous situations. Someone who 
has been drinking is NOT able to give consent. 
STOP immediately so you both stay safe.
- If someone says “NO” in any sexual 
situation, it means NO. To ignore it is 
wrong and against the law.
- Intimate and sexual situations should 
always be consensual, safe, and respectful. 
Talking about desires and concerns will help 
you both feel comfortable.
