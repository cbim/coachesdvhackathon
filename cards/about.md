Whether you're a coach, a school administrator, a parent, a violence prevention activist, or a community leader, YOU have a role in Coaching Boys into Men (CBIM). By coaching boys into men, you are helping the next generation build respectful and non-violent relationships.

### Coaching Boys into Men® is a Coaches Leadership Program that partners with athletic coaches to help young male athletes practice respect towards themselves and others.

Athletic coaches play an extremely influential and unique role in the lives of young men, often serving as a parent or mentor to the boys they coach. Because of these special relationships, coaches are poised to positively influence how young men think and behave both on, and off, the field. From speeches to the team, practice sessions, or simply casual conversation, coaches have many opportunities to impart their philosophies upon their athletes. The program equips coaches to talk with their athletes about respect for women and girls and that violence doesn't equal strength. Through CBIM, athletes learn skills to avoid violence and abuse in their relationships.

### This application includes the following tools:
- The CBIM Coaches Card Series helps coaches integrate the lessons of respect in relationships into twelve weekly trainings throughout their athletic season. The program guides coaches through each training session to address respect, integrity, and non-violence with their athletes.
- The beginning of the sports season is a convenient time to start Coaching Boys into Men (CBIM). Here’s how you can begin CBIM with your athletes:
- **Set aside at least 15-20 minutes per week** to lead your athletes through a training in the Card Series. Each training will encourage your athletes to discuss and practice respect and non-violence for themselves, others, and the women and girls in their lives. Although each of the trainings is intended to be brief, it’s the consistency of the message and repeated weekly lessons that will make the greatest impact. We recommend leading the trainings on a weekly basis, in sequential order, and completing the series over the course of the season.
