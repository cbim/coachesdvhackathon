Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
In our game, winning 
not only requires physical 
strength, but at times it also 
requires aggressiveness. 
Sometimes, we even want to 
intimidate our opponent to get that 
extra edge; but even this must be 
done within bounds. Things can 
go too far if you’re not in control 
of your emotions. This is also true 
outside the competition in your 
everyday lives. 
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. How does aggression help you in the 
game? What are the rules that maintain 
fairness and help players avoid injury?
2. How do you feel when you become more 
aggressive during a game?
3. What problems can being too aggressive 
cause outside the game?
4. What are some suggestions for 
controlling aggression?


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Sports require aggression. The goal is often 
to dominate and intimidate your opponent. But 
in sports, aggression is controlled by rules. If 
you break them, you could be penalized or 
even ejected. The same is true off the field. 
- We all have moments when we become 
frustrated or angry but this should never lead 
you to be violent or abusive. 
- Like in the game, there can be serious 
consequences when your aggression crosses 
the line in real life. Abuse or violence can 
result in losing your relationship or even 
legal consequences like going to jail.
- You are in control and responsible for all of 
your actions and emotions on and off the field.
- Learn to recognize when you’re becoming 
overly aggressive and think about what you 
need to do to cool down. It could be taking a 
deep breath, talking it over with your friends, 
or doing something you enjoy to take your 
mind off the situation.
- Always remember that violence doesn’t 
equal strength.
