Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
Since this is the start of the 
season, I want to talk about your 
responsibilities on this team and my 
expectations of you. This season 
we’ll not only be focusing on your 
development as athletes, but also 
on your development as young men. 
This includes how you carry yourself 
and how you treat others, particularly 
women and girls like your girlfriend 
or your sister. Each week, I want 
to talk to you guys about some 
of these things. Starting today, we 
will focus on how we can better 
show respect to ourselves, your teammates, and others.
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What does respect mean to you?
2. How can you show respect to your 
teammates?
3. How can you show respect to your 
friends and family? 
4. How do you show respect even 
to people you don’t know, like at a 
restaurant or at the mall?

Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Be a team player. This means respecting 
your teammates, displaying good 
sportsmanship, and being in control of 
your own actions.
- You reflect our team, our school, the 
community, and your family and friends. 
- Accountability means holding yourself 
responsible – and that is something that 
you, and only you, can do.
- One thing we’re going to focus on this 
season is that there are real consequences 
for yourself and others when you don’t 
treat people with respect.
