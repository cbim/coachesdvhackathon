Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
You know from prior 
talks that it’s important to me 
for all of us to treat women 
and girls with respect. 
Sometimes guys 
just think they’re being 
funny or cool and don’t 
realize that their behavior 
is actually disrespectful or 
even threatening.
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. What are some examples of disrespectful 
behaviors towards women and girls?
2. Have you heard guys describing girls as 
stupid or easy?
3. Why do you think guys call out to girls 
about how they look or what they’re wearing?
4. How do you think this type of attention might 
make someone feel? Why could this be hurtful?
5. What can you do when you hear your 
friends making disrespectful comments to girls?

Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- Disrespectful behavior can be hurtful and 
frightening. Even if someone laughs it off, 
chances are they didn’t find it funny at all.
- Describing girls as stupid or easy reinforces 
negative stereotypes. How do you feel when 
someone insults you? It’s unacceptable. 
- Whether it’s that we want people to think 
we’re smart, funny, or athletic, we all want to 
be liked and respected – both guys and girls. 
No one wants to be insulted or harassed. 
- Guys might think they’re flirting or being 
funny or cool when commenting on a girl’s 
clothing or appearance – they’re not. They 
might even think she is asking for these 
unwanted comments, but that’s wrong too. 
No one asks to be harassed or singled out 
because of how they look.
- If you’re interested in getting to know 
someone, talk to him/her in a mature and 
respectful way.
