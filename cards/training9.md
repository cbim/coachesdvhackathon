This training will help athletes:
1. Reject the use of pressure or intimidation 
in their relationships and friendships.
2. Refer back to tools on how to monitor 
aggression and determine when it crosses 
the line.
3. Refuse to become abusive or violent in 
their relationships.
</strong>

Warm Up
-------
<blockquote>
We’ve talked this 
season about aggression, 
physical strength, and respect. 
I also want to talk about 
relationships and how problems will 
inevitably come up – and that’s ok, 
it’s natural. But, we must deal with 
them in a positive and healthy way. 
Sometimes people use pressure to 
force someone into doing something 
they don’t want to do. They may 
even use violence to control their 
girlfriend or boyfriend, but it’s never 
okay. Never. There are better 
ways to handle any issue 
that may arise. 
</blockquote>

Ask the Players
---------------
1. How can you tell someone that you 
don’t like the way they’re treating you or 
someone else? 
2. What could you do if you saw a friend 
yelling at or intimidating someone they’re 
seeing? 
3. What are non-violent ways to deal with 
relationship problems or differences?


Discussion Points & Wrap Up
---------------------------
- In any relationship, there will be issues 
and disagreements, but that is never an 
excuse for violence.
- It’s never right to be physically, verbally, 
or sexually abusive towards another 
person, period. 
- Any time you witness abuse, learn 
about it occurring, or if you experience 
it yourself, you should report it to me or 
another trusted adult such as a teacher or 
parent immediately.
- When someone says “NO” in any sexual 
situation, it means NO. To ignore it is 
WRONG and it’s AGAINST THE LAW.
- Respecting the physical and emotional 
boundaries and desires of others will help 
you build strong and healthy relationships 
throughout your life.
